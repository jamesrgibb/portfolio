        <h2 class= "title">about me:</h2>
        <p>I am a web developer attending the University of Utah. I am majoring in Computer Science,
            as well as a student at Thinkful in the Full Stack Flex bootcamp. I was drawn to coding because 
            it makes our world more efficient, and thats what motivates me. It's exhilarating to find
            better ways to do things, and constantly improve. I got into coding while trying to buy 
            limited shoes with my friends. We helped each other learn different parts of html and javascript. 
            Then, we adapted our programs run at faster speeds to be able to buy even the most coveted sneakers.</p>
