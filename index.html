        <h2 class= "title">about me:</h2>
        <p>I am a web developer attending the University of Utah. I am majoring in Computer Science,
            as well as a student at Thinkful in the Full Stack Flex bootcamp. I was drawn to coding because 
            it makes our world more efficient, and thats what motivates me. It's exhilarating to find
            better ways to do things, and constantly improving. I got into coding while trying to buy 
            limited shoes. I am a sneakerhead and love collecting different shoes.</p>
